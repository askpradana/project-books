reserved for future edit, Ill back to this proejct soon.
feel free to fork, edit, PR or anything else with this code, just dont make money with it without telling me first
*notes for me: its built with nextjs for backend and frontend and use neon as database online
You could search the .env file on your neon account

# NOTES
Guys sorry I accidentally deleted the entire database for my other projects LOL.
I already uploaded the .env.example please use that and make your own database for using this project

### how-to connect to your local/online database
1. create your database
2. create .env from .env.example (just duplicate it)
3. in terminal do this
> npx prisma db pull
and then
> npx prisma generate
4. alright then just run
> npm run dev
